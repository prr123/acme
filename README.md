# acme
This repository contains acme test program(s) to test implementations of crypto/acme with a dns01 challenge.
The programs are based on the golang acme package, let's encrypt acting as the acme server and the CA, and the cloudflare API to change dns records. 

These programs also assume the following:  
1. There is a directory called LEAcnt and an environmental variable named LEAcnt which points to the folder LEAcnt.
2. There is a directory called zoneDir and an environmental variable named zoneDir wich points to that folder.
3. There is a directory called certDir and an environmental variable named certDir which points to the certdir.  

## zoneDir
This folder should contain a file named cfDomainsShort.yaml. The file contains the names and ids of all domains that are served with cloudflare's nameservers from your cloudflare account. The file content is generated by a the program [createDomainList]

## LEAcnt

This account contains (for now) the private and public key for the Let's Encrypt account. These keys are generated with the program 


## acme flow

### Step 1: Create CA Account

#### generate new account with CreLEAcnt

Program generates a private and public key (LE_private.key and LE_public.key). The key files are stored in the PEM format in the folder LEAcnt.  


### Step 2: Retrieve the CA Account and generate Acme Client  

GetLEAcnt retrieves the LE Account. This program can be used to check the existence of the LE Account.

The program, CreateCert, will retrieve the LE Account and generate an Acme client.

## programs

### readCsrList
program that reads a CsrList yaml file  

usage: ./RdCsrList /csr=csrList.yaml  

### checkLEAcnt
program that reads a yaml account file and checks the validity of the account with the LE CA.  

uasage ./checkLEAcnt /acnt=accountname [/dbg]  

### checkChal
program reads csrList File to check whether each domain has a DNS challenge record



### createCerts
The program createCerts creates x509 certificates. The generated certificates are stored in the directory LEAcnt/certs. The program uses a csr file as input. Csr files are stored in the directory LEAcnt/csrList.  
Note: if the csr file contains multiple domain names, only a single certificate containing all domain names is being generated.  

usage: ./createCerts /csr=csrList.yaml [/dbg]  

### createMultiCerts
The program createMultiCerts creates one x509 certificate pair for each domain name listed in the csr file. The generated certificates are stored in the directory LEAcnt/certs. The program uses a csr file as input. Csr files are stored in the directory LEAcnt/csrList.  

usage: ./createCerts /csr=csrList.yaml [/dbg]  

### testDnsChal
The program testDnsChal performs a dns lookup on each domain in the csr file to see whether the domain name server has a acme challenge record. The program tests each domain listed in the csr file.  

usage: ./testDnsChal /csr=csrList.yaml /dbg  

### cleanDnsChal
This program removes all Dns challenge records for the domains listed in the csr file and cleans the csr file.  

usage: ./cleanDnsChal /csr=csrList.yaml /dbg  

### fetchCertsFromCa


### readPemCerts


#### Flow

1. read CsrList
2. read list of domains (zones) managed under cloudflare
3. create list of domains for certs
4. establish account with Lets Encrypt
5. from Let's Encrypt (LE) get authorisation order for the domain target list (step 3) for DNS challenge
6. for each domain:
   1. get authorization url
   2. get token
   3. add DNS text record to domain nameserver
   4. check by reading added Dns TXT record via lookup
   5. inform LE 
   6. confirm LE has validated challenge
   7. delete DNS text record from name server
   8. generate cert key and save as pem file in certDir
   9. generate CSR request
   10. submit CSR request to LE
   11. retrieve cert as bundle (cert chain) and save as pem file in certDir

dns provider is limited to cloudflare initially.
